Fitting code that takes a CCQEMAT sidebands output file and fits them by category. 

in the make_hists directory 

cmake fits
make

then 

./MnvFitDriver FitTest.json

FitTest.json looks like 

'''
{ "InputFile":"/Users/schellma/Dropbox/CCQE/SB_Sean_local_Nu_v8_1track_1.root",
    "Sidebands":["QElike","MichelSideBand","BlobSideBand","MicBlobSideBand"],
    "IncludeInFit":["MichelSideBand","BlobSideBand","MicBlobSideBand"],
    "Categories":["qelike","1chargedpion","1neutralpion","multipion","other"],
    "Variable":"ptmu",
    "FitType":"SlowChi2", //
  "OutputFile":"Fitresult1.root",
  "LogPlot":false
}
'''

This tells it which file to read, which sidebands are in the file, which ones to fit, and what categories to fit them too. 
There are 3 fit types available. FastChi2 uses the sqrt(data) for the error, SlowChi2 uses the sqrt(mc), "ML" tries Maximum Likelihood but that fails a lot.
