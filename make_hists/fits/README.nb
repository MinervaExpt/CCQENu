Fitting code that takes a CCQEMAT sidebands output file and fits them by category. 

in the make_hists directory 

cmake fits
make

then 

./MnvFitDriver FitTest.json

FitTest.json looks like 

'''
{
    "InputFile":"/Users/schellma/Dropbox/CCQE/SB_Sean_mnv_Nu_v8_multitrack_1.root",
    "Sidebands":["QElike","MichelSideBand","BlobSideBand","MicBlobSideBand"],
    "IncludeInFit":["MichelSideBand","BlobSideBand","MicBlobSideBand"],
    "Categories":["qelike","1chargedpion","1neutralpion","multipion","other"],
    "Backgrounds":["1chargedpion","1neutralpion","multipion","other"],
    "Variable":"ptmu",
    "FitType":"SlowChi2",
    "OutputFile":"Fitresult1.root",
    "LogPlot":false,
    "Template":"h___%s___%s___%s___reconstructed",
    "FitTemplate":"h___%s___%s___%s___fitted"
}
'''

This tells it which file to read, which sidebands are in the file, which ones to fit, and what categories to fit them too. 
There are 3 fit types available. FastChi2 uses the sqrt(data) for the error, SlowChi2 uses the sqrt(mc), "ML" tries Maximum Likelihood but that fails more frequently.

The fit function, parameters and covariance matrix are outputted as MnvH1D and 2D.

And all of the input info should be carried forward from the input file so that this can be used as input to analyzer.
