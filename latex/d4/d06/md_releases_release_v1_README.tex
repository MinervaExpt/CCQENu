This directory contains csv files for the MINERvA anti-\/neutrino CCQE-\/like measurements There are two subdirectories\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{fixed}} is fixed format cross section scaled by 1E39
\item {\bfseries{full}} is full double precision
\end{DoxyItemize}

data and model files are stored as follows

filenames are\+:

MINERv\+A\+\_\+\+Anti\+Neutrino\+\_\+\+CCQElike\+\_\+\+VAR\+\_\+\+TYPE\+\_\+\+MODEL\+\_\+\+CONTENT\+\_\+\+DIM.\+csv

{\bfseries{VAR}} can be Enu, Enu\+QE, q2, pzmu, ptmu or pzmu\+\_\+ptmu

{\bfseries{TYPE}} can be Data or MC ~\newline
 Data\+Full and MCFull refer to the special energy plots corrected to the full angle phase space without the final state proton energy cut.

{\bfseries{MODEL}} refers to the GENIE2.\+12.\+6 variation\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item GENIE2.\+12.\+6 = default GENIE
\item 2p2h = replaces the GENIE RPA with our tuned 2p2h
\item rpa = adds RPA
\item piontune = adds pion tune (negligible effect)
\item MINERv\+A\+\_\+v1 = MINERvA v1 tune (used for extraction)
\item MINERv\+A\+\_\+v2 = MINERvA v2 tune
\item Meas is for data
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{CONTENT}} can be\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item meta, some description of the files, including scaling, binwidth corrections...
\item values, the cross section values -\/ in the Fixed directory these are scaled by 1E39.
\item bins, the bins, low edges are listed with the last \# being the high end of the last bin
\item staterrors, statistical errors
\item systerrors, systematic errors
\item errors, combined statistical and systematic
\item covariance, the full covariance matrix
\item correlation, the full correlation matrix
\item vertdump, a dump of all the separate fractional uncertainties due to individual sources
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{DIM}} can be\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item px\+\_\+1d the px and py are there because these are projections of 2-\/d histograms
\item py\+\_\+1d
\item 2d ~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}

In the 2d files, the ordering is column is increasing x-\/view (pzmu), row is increasing y-\/view (ptmu). ~\newline
 In the covariance and correlation matrix the ordering is pzbin + ptbin$\ast$(Npzbin)
