Naming convention for CCQEMAT histograms

h\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+\+Sample\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+category\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+variable\+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+type

fields are separated by \+\_\+\+\_\+\+\_\+ 3 \+\_\+

field 1 is h or h2d

field 2 is the reconstruction level Sample name (capitalized)

field 3 is the truth level category (lower case)

field 4 is the variable, if 2D it is var1\+\_\+var2

field 5 is the data type\+:

reconstructed – for raw reconstruction fitted – after sideband fits weighted – if signal fraction weights applied response\+\_\+migration, response\+\_\+reco, response\+\_\+truth – for response selected\+\_\+truth for truth that reconstructed cuts truth for all truth in the true fiducial volume
